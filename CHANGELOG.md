# Change Log

## !Deploy

* [Fix] Fixed the `-ClearSceen` switch to only clear the screen after a difference has occurred when `-Diff` is used and before returning the first result when `-PassThru` is used. (Thanks [@ZHider](https://github.com/ZHider)!)

## [1.0.30] - 2023-03-08

* [Feature] Added a `-PassThru` parameter to `Watch-Command` so that the initial result is immediately returned, per the suggestion from [@th0th](https://github.com/th0th) in [#2](https://github.com/markwragg/PowerShell-Watch/issues/2)

## [1.0.29] - 2019-09-10

* Test deployment.
